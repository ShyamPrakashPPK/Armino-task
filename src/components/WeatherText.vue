                Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or
                dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.[1] On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the
                planet's atmosphere, the troposphere,[2][3] just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day
                temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of
                atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[4] When used without qualification, "weather" is generally
                understood to mean the weather of Earth.
